# Human Readable Code Skill

## Purpose
Use this skill when reviewing, writing, or refactoring code to improve human readability.

The goal is to produce code that another developer can understand quickly without reverse-engineering the intent.

## Core Principle
Optimize for the human reader, not the computer.

A reader should be able to answer:
- What does this do?
- Why does it exist?
- How is it supposed to work?

## Guidelines

### 1. Use clear names
Prefer names that describe intent, not mechanics.

Good:
- `get_user_profile(user_id)`
- `calculate_total_price()`
- `send_password_reset_email()`

Avoid vague names like:
- `x`
- `data`
- `temp`
- `handleStuff()`

### 2. Keep functions small and focused
Each function should do one clear job.

Prefer:
1. validate input
2. transform data
3. perform action
4. return result

Split functions that combine validation, persistence, notifications, and logging unless there is a strong reason not to.

### 3. Favor consistency
Use predictable structure across the codebase.

Be consistent with:
- indentation
- import ordering
- naming conventions
- file layout
- return patterns
- error handling

Consistency lowers cognitive load.

### 4. Avoid clever code
Do not compress logic just because the language allows it.

Prefer obvious code over dense code.

If a one-liner is harder to understand than a few explicit lines, use the explicit version.

### 5. Preserve logical flow
Code should read like a sequence of understandable steps.

A good structure often looks like:
1. validate
2. prepare
3. execute
4. return

Avoid jumping between unrelated concerns.

### 6. Use meaningful abstraction
Hide complexity behind interfaces that match domain intent.

Prefer:
- `create_user(user)`
- `fetch_invoice(invoice_id)`
- `archive_project(project_id)`

Over exposing low-level implementation unless necessary.

### 7. Comment why, not what
Use comments to explain intent, constraints, tradeoffs, or non-obvious decisions.

Good comments explain:
- why this exists
- why this approach was chosen
- what edge case is being handled
- what external constraint matters

Avoid comments that merely restate the code.

### 8. Make behavior predictable
Function names, module layout, and control flow should help the reader guess what happens before reading every line.

Readable code is unsurprising.

### 9. Avoid unnecessary abstraction

### 10. Comments choice and conciseness
When you know a line of code has a deeper nature to it, a comment should be added, but it should not be
"wordy" in a fillter sense, and loose grammar or actionable phrasing is preferred to avoid having to
read too much and know exactly what the main point of the comment or complexity is. Longer length is okay,
but conciseness is key. Human eyes go to the comments first.

### 11. Boolean conditional logic syntax
Consider two different examples that are functionally equivalent, but the second uses a guard technique.

In general, for readability boolean logic, you want to use the first example. However, in many cases
like especially for missing data, using the guard technique is just fine even great.

- Example 1:
```python
    is_sale = self.type == "sale"
    is_rental = self.is_rental_conversion_eligible == False
    bom_none = self.bom == None

    def is_required(self):
        return (
            bom_none
            and is_sale
            and !is_rental
        )

```

- Example 2:
```python
    is_sale = self.type == "sale"
    is_rental = self.is_rental_conversion_eligible == False
    bom_none = self.bom == None

    def is_required(self):
        if !is_rental:
            return False

        return (
            bom_none
            and is_sale
        )
```

## Review Checklist
Before finalizing code, check:
- Are names explicit and meaningful?
- Does each function have a single clear responsibility?
- Is the structure consistent with nearby code?
- Is any part unnecessarily clever?
- Does the control flow read naturally?
- Are abstractions named around intent?
- Do comments explain why instead of what?
- Could another developer understand this in 30 seconds?

## Refactoring Heuristics
When improving readability:
- rename unclear variables and functions
- split large functions into focused helpers
- replace nested logic with guard clauses where appropriate
- separate domain logic from I/O or framework code
- extract repeated logic into well-named functions
- remove dead code and noisy comments
- prefer explicit intermediate variables when they improve clarity

## Output Standard
When writing or revising code with this skill:
- prioritize clarity over terseness
- preserve correctness and behavior
- improve names first
- simplify flow second
- add brief explanatory comments only where needed
- avoid unnecessary abstraction

## One-Line Test
A competent developer should be able to understand the code in about 30 seconds.
